# The North Face E-commerce : boosting online sales with NLP !
In this project, I work with a corpus of product's descriptions from a well-known brand's product catalog.

## Goal of the project
The main goal is to use some NLP techniques to analyze text description of the product catalog in order to identify similar products, build a recommender system and create new topics with more meaning.

## Datasets
The data provided for this project gathers 500 product's SKUs, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cclark/product-item-data).
